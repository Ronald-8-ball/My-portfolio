    <h1>More of Me</h1>
    <p>I am Ronald Etim Okuk, a 14-year-old from Akwa Ibom State, Oron LGA, Nigeria, born in November 2010. My journey in
    technology started with a curiosity about how things work, which quickly grew into a passion for programming and
    problem-solving. I enjoy working on projects such as games, websites, and coding experiments that allow me to apply what
    I learn and improve my skills.
    
    Iâ€™m passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning, and I love challenging myself with coding
    problems, even when they feel tough at first. My goal is to keep growing as a developer, explore different areas of
    tech, and eventually use my skills to make a positive impact in my community and beyond.</p>
